 console.log("hello world") ;
 console.log("hello world") ;


//we have to use try and catch :-we use try to that piece of code where we are unsure about the output jaha shak hoye hame taki pura niche ka program waste na hoo :-

try{
console.log(a) ;                    
}

catch(err)
{
    console.log("Caught an Error: variable a is not defined") ; //now the below code will execute as we have caught the error.
    console.log(err);
} 

//upar ke 3 statement execute honge without any issue but jaise heee ye statement me error aaya niche ke jo 3 statement the wo execute nhi huee to solve this problem we use try and  catch taki agar error aaye bhee to we can still print or output the below statment to protect my website from crashing.

 console.log("hello world") ;
 console.log("hello world") ;
 console.log("hello world") ;


 //try statement :- try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for erroes while it is being executed while the catch statement a;;pws you to define a block of code to be ececuted ,if an eroor occi=urs in the try block
