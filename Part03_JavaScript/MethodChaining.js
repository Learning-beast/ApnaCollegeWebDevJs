//Method chaining :- Using one method after another Order of excecution will be from left to right.

let name = "    harsh singh parihar  " ;

let newname = name.trim().toUpperCase().split(); //output: HARSH SINGH PARIHAR

console.log(newname); //output: HARSH SINGH PARIHAR



//Method chaining is more useful as it allows to perform mutiple method on a single line of a code
