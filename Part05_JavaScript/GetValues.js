//to access the values in the object:-

let student = {
    name : "harsh singh",
    marks : 94.4,
    subjects : ["physics","chemistry"]
};


//to access the values there are two ways :- studetn["name"] or student.name

console.log(student["name"]);
console.log(student.name);   //mostly this is used 

//javascript autmatically converts the key to string so we can also use the key as a string to access the value.
